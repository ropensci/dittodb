}
\arguments{

\item{...}{additional arguments (to allow for things like \code{schema_name} that
\code{odbc} uses.)}

\description{
Tables are identified and specified with a large number of ways across
drivers. For the purposes of \code{dittodb}, the details are less important since
we almost always just want a flat representation (\emph{ie} for filenames). This
takes the various formats and returns a string with various elements
separated by dots.
