\description{
If you would like to use \code{dittodb} in your package, and you are already using
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat}{{testthat}}, use this function to
add \code{dittodb} to Suggests in the package DESCRIPTION and loads it in
\code{tests/testthat/helper.R}. Call it once when you're setting up a new package
test suite.
}
\details{
This function should be called with the path to your package source as the
\code{path} argument. The function is idempotent: if \code{dittodb} is already added to
these files, no additional changes will be made.

It will:
\itemize{
\item add \code{dittodb} to the \code{Suggests} field of the DESCRIPTION file in the
current working directory
\item add \code{library(dittodb)} to the file \code{tests/testthat/helper.R} (creating it
if it doesn't already exist)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
use_dittodb()
use_dittodb("/path/to/package")
}
}
