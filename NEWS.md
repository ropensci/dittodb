# dittodb 0.1.7
* Added better capture support for unknown databases including better capture support for Teradata databases. (#176, @sandstumpen)

# dittodb 0.1.6
* Bugfix for `integer64` roundtrips. Instead of falling back to non-hexNumeric output, we serialize first and maintain hexNumeric output.

# dittodb 0.1.5
* There is now better support for {dbplyr} editions: mocks should transparently use whatever the backend supports now (#169)
* Improved `bigint` support (thanks to @majazaloznik for reporting this issue, #168)
* Quoting should be more reliable (e.g. quotes are doubled with RPostgres drivers), uncovered by a change in {dbplyr} query optimizations (#172)
* SQLite databases
* Removed the "travelling" vignette since there are much better ways to do something like that now (e.g. {duckdb})

## Internals
* Switched from a semi-hacky C-based approach for creating mock connections, that now uses tracing like capturing already did (#167)
* Various test improvements (thanks @majazaloznik)
* Removed `expect_silent()` in one test to satisfy an R devel bug (#172)
* The pkgdown site should render more correctly (thanks to @maelle, #173)

# dittodb 0.1.4
* Allow support for mocking when transactions are on (full support for transactions with different mock directories is still planned for the future)
* Add support for quoting with Postgres

# dittodb 0.1.3
* Minor CRAN update that makes vignette execution conditional when `Suggests` packages are not available.

# dittodb 0.1.2
## New features
* Experimental support for [`expect_sql()`] to check if a specific SQL statement is sent in a test without needing a fixture. Useful for when you only want or need to check that a specific query was sent and you don't need to check any code after that. This feature is experimental, so might change in a subsequent release. 

## Bug fixes and test improvements 
* ODBC connections that only specify a dsn now use the dsn as the path (@klmr, #132). 
* Compatibility for the forthcoming {testthat} 3e.
* Test changes for {dbplyr} (@hadley, #134).
* Internal updates for changes in an upcoming {dbplyr} release.

# dittodb 0.1.1
* Minor CRAN update that makes tests and examples conditional when `Suggests` packages are not available.

# dittodb 0.1.0 
* Initial release with functionality for recording and playing back database fixtures from a number of DBI-based drivers ({RSQLite}, {RPostgres}, {RMariaDB}, {RPostgreSQL})
* Thanks to @maelle for PR#12
* `nycflights13_create_sql()` now always uses {DBI}
* bug fixes to cope with {dbplyr}'s unique table name functions and quoting
